# 🔐 User Permissions System Guide

## ✨ Overview

The application now implements a comprehensive permission system that restricts users' access to data based on their assigned **regions**, **channels**, and **classifications**. This ensures data isolation and security across different user roles.

## 🏗️ Permission Structure

### **User Roles**
- **Admin**: Full access to all data (no restrictions)
- **Manager**: Limited access based on assigned permissions

### **Permission Dimensions**
1. **Regions**: Users can be assigned to one or more geographic regions
2. **Channels**: Users can be assigned to one or more sales channels (retail, wholesale, etc.)
3. **Classifications**: Users can be restricted to `food`, `non_food`, or `both` product types

## 👥 Test User Accounts

| Username | Password | Role | Classification | Regions | Channels | Access Level |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `admin` | `password` | Admin | - | All | All | Everything |
| `manager` | `password` | Manager | Food | North Region | Retail | Food products in North/Retail only |
| `manager2` | `password` | Manager | Non-Food | South Region | Wholesale | Non-food products in South/Wholesale only |
| `manager3` | `password` | Manager | Both | North + South | Retail + Wholesale | All products in assigned regions/channels |

## 🎯 What's Filtered by Permissions

### **Target Matrix (/targets)**
- **Salesmen**: Only show salesmen in user's assigned regions/channels/classifications
- **Suppliers**: Only show suppliers matching user's classification
- **Categories**: Only show categories from accessible suppliers
- **Targets**: Only show/allow editing targets within user's scope

### **Dropdown APIs (/api/v1/deps/)**
- **Regions**: Only user's assigned regions
- **Channels**: Only user's assigned channels
- **Salesmen**: Filtered by region + channel + classification
- **Suppliers**: Filtered by classification
- **Categories**: Filtered by supplier classification

### **CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: Users can only create targets within their permissions
- **Read**: Users only see data they have access to
- **Update**: Users can only modify targets within their scope
- **Delete**: Users can only delete targets within their scope
- **Bulk Operations**: All bulk saves/uploads respect user permissions

## 🧪 How to Test Permissions

### **1. Login as Food Manager**
```bash
Username: manager
Password: password
```
**Expected Behavior:**
- Target matrix only shows food classification data
- Regions dropdown only shows "North Region"
- Channels dropdown only shows "Retail"
- Suppliers dropdown only shows food suppliers
- Cannot create/edit targets outside food classification

### **2. Login as Non-Food Manager**
```bash
Username: manager2  
Password: password
```
**Expected Behavior:**
- Target matrix only shows non-food classification data
- Regions dropdown only shows "South Region"
- Channels dropdown only shows "Wholesale"
- Suppliers dropdown only shows non-food suppliers
- Cannot access North region or Retail channel data

### **3. Login as Multi-Access Manager**
```bash
Username: manager3
Password: password
```
**Expected Behavior:**
- Target matrix shows both food and non-food data
- Regions dropdown shows both "North Region" and "South Region"
- Channels dropdown shows both "Retail" and "Wholesale"
- All suppliers visible
- Can create/edit targets across all assigned areas

### **4. Login as Admin**
```bash
Username: admin
Password: password
```
**Expected Behavior:**
- Complete access to all data
- No restrictions on any operations
- Can see and manage everything

## 🔧 Managing User Permissions

### **Assigning Regions to Users**
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->regions()->attach([1, 2]); // Assign regions 1 and 2
$user->regions()->sync([1]);      // Replace with only region 1
$user->regions()->detach();       // Remove all region assignments
```

### **Assigning Channels to Users**
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->channels()->attach([1, 2]); // Assign channels 1 and 2
$user->channels()->sync([2]);      // Replace with only channel 2
$user->channels()->detach();       // Remove all channel assignments
```

### **Setting Classification**
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->update(['classification' => 'food']);      // Food only
$user->update(['classification' => 'non_food']);  // Non-food only
$user->update(['classification' => 'both']);      // Both types
$user->update(['classification' => null]);        // No restriction
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **API Protection**
- All API endpoints validate user permissions
- Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden
- Data filtering happens at the database level

### **Frontend Integration**
- Dropdown menus automatically filtered
- Target matrix respects user scope
- Export/import operations honor permissions

### **Bulk Operations**
- CSV uploads skip unauthorized data
- Bulk saves only process permitted targets
- Clear error messages for permission violations

## 📊 Permission Validation Examples

### **Checking User Scope**
```php
$user = Auth::user();
$scope = $user->scope();

// Returns null for admin, or array like:
// [
//     'region_ids' => [1, 2],
//     'channel_ids' => [1],
//     'classification' => 'food'
// ]
```

### **Applying Filters in Controllers**
```php
// Example: Filter salesmen by user permissions
$salesmen = Salesman::query();

if (!$user->isAdmin()) {
    $scope = $user->scope();
    
    if (!empty($scope['region_ids'])) {
        $salesmen->whereIn('region_id', $scope['region_ids']);
    }
    
    if (!empty($scope['channel_ids'])) {
        $salesmen->whereIn('channel_id', $scope['channel_ids']);
    }
    
    if (isset($scope['classification']) && $scope['classification'] !== 'both') {
        $salesmen->where('classification', $scope['classification']);
    }
}
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Users only see relevant data for their role
2. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new regions, channels, or classifications
4. **Flexibility**: Users can have multiple permissions across dimensions
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear permission boundaries for compliance
6. **User Experience**: Cleaner interfaces with relevant data only

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test each user account** to verify permission filtering works correctly
2. **Create additional users** with different permission combinations as needed
3. **Monitor the application** to ensure no unauthorized data access occurs
4. **Customize permissions** based on your specific organizational structure

**The permission system is now fully implemented and ready for production use! 🚀**
