# üîß User Permission Filter Fix - Testing Instructions

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Manager users were seeing "No Data Available" because their classification filter wasn't automatically applied.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was defaulting to "All Types" instead of the user's assigned classification.

**Solution**: Added automatic filter detection and application based on user permissions.

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### **1. Clear Browser Cache**
```
Press Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R to hard refresh the page
```

### **2. Test Manager User (Food Classification)**
```
1. Login as: manager / password
2. Navigate to: /targets
3. Expected Result:
   ‚úÖ Classification dropdown automatically shows "Food"
   ‚úÖ Region dropdown automatically shows "North Region" 
   ‚úÖ Channel dropdown automatically shows "Retail"
   ‚úÖ Target matrix loads with food classification data
   ‚úÖ No manual filter selection required
```

### **3. Test Manager2 User (Non-Food Classification)**
```
1. Login as: manager2 / password  
2. Navigate to: /targets
3. Expected Result:
   ‚úÖ Classification dropdown automatically shows "Non-Food"
   ‚úÖ Region dropdown automatically shows "South Region"
   ‚úÖ Channel dropdown automatically shows "Wholesale" 
   ‚úÖ Target matrix loads with non-food classification data
```

### **4. Test Manager3 User (Both Classifications)**
```
1. Login as: manager3 / password
2. Navigate to: /targets  
3. Expected Result:
   ‚úÖ Classification dropdown shows "Both" (or can be manually changed)
   ‚úÖ Region dropdown shows multiple regions available
   ‚úÖ Channel dropdown shows multiple channels available
   ‚úÖ Target matrix loads with all classification data within assigned scope
```

### **5. Test Admin User (No Restrictions)**
```
1. Login as: admin / password
2. Navigate to: /targets
3. Expected Result:
   ‚úÖ All filters remain as "All Types/Regions/Channels"
   ‚úÖ No automatic filter application
   ‚úÖ Full access to all data
```

## üîç Technical Details

### **New API Endpoint Added**
```
GET /api/v1/user/info
```
**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "role": "manager",
    "classification": "food", 
    "is_admin": false,
    "scope": {
      "region_ids": [1],
      "channel_ids": [1],
      "classification": "food"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Enhancement**
- `loadMasterData()` now calls `setUserClassificationFilter()`
- Automatically applies user's classification filter on page load
- Auto-selects region/channel when user has only one option
- Provides console logging for debugging

### **Console Debugging**
Open browser developer tools (F12) and check console for:
```
Auto-applied user filters - Classification: food, Regions: 1, Channels: 1
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior Changes

| User Type | Previous Behavior | New Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **manager** | "All Types" + "No Data Available" | Auto "Food" + Target data visible |
| **manager2** | "All Types" + "No Data Available" | Auto "Non-Food" + Target data visible |
| **manager3** | "All Types" + Limited data | Auto "Both" + Full scope data visible |
| **admin** | "All Types" + All data | "All Types" + All data (unchanged) |

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

1. **Login as manager user**
2. **Check classification dropdown** - should show "Food" automatically
3. **Click "Load Matrix"** - should display target data immediately
4. **Check console logs** - should show auto-filter application
5. **Verify target data** - should show only food classification targets

## üöÄ Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: No manual filter selection required
- **Consistent Data Access**: Users see only their permitted data automatically
- **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminates "No Data Available" for authorized users
- **Better Security**: Ensures users only see data within their scope
- **Intuitive Interface**: Filters reflect user's actual permissions

**The fix ensures that users immediately see the data they have permission to access without any manual filter configuration! üéâ**
