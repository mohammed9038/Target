# 🔧 Classification Filtering Fix - RESOLVED

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

**Problem**: Manager users were seeing "No Data Available" because they couldn't access salesmen with `classification: 'both'`.

**Root Cause**: The classification filtering logic was too restrictive:
- Users with `classification: 'food'` could only see salesmen with `classification: 'food'`
- But they should also see salesmen with `classification: 'both'`

## 🔨 Solution Implemented

### **Updated Classification Logic**
Changed from **exact match** to **inclusive match**:

```sql
-- BEFORE (too restrictive)
WHERE classification = 'food'

-- AFTER (properly inclusive)  
WHERE (classification = 'food' OR classification = 'both')
```

### **Files Updated**
1. **TargetController.php**:
   - `getMatrix()` method - salesmen and targets queries
   - `bulkSave()` method - permission checking
   
2. **DependentController.php**:
   - `salesmen()` method - API endpoint filtering

## 🎉 Problem Solved

The fundamental issue was **overly restrictive classification filtering**. Now:

- **food users** can see: food salesmen + both salesmen
- **non_food users** can see: non_food salesmen + both salesmen  
- **both users** can see: all salesmen
- **admin users** can see: everything (unchanged)

**Users can now see their target data and create targets within their permissions! 🚀**
